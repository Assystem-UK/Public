# Assystem-UK GitHub
This is a pilot organisation of GitHub repositories for use by anyone in Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Ltd.

Repositories under this tab will initially be private, so you can't see them unless your GitHub account is added to the Assystem-UK 'organisation'. Contact Michael Battye or Greig Marshall to arrange this. Once added, you'll be able to see private repos and create your own.
